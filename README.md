# Spring boot embedded Kafka example #

![franz.kafka](franz.kafka.jpg "fanz.kafka")

This is a very simple spring boot example of how to test sender and receiver with an embedded kafka server

#### Things to keep in mind

* Upgrading kafka wont be a good idea since there are coming strange dependency problems 
* Please do not use the test as a "best practice" example ;)
* Feel free and make merge requests for perfection :)
